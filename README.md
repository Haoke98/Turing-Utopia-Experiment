# Turing Utopia Experiment
<center><a href="README.zh.md">‰∏≠Êñá</a> | English</center>

Built upon Conway's Game of Life, referencing the Utopia Experiment, and studying the butterfly effect, the project simulates and predicts non-living phenomena. It explores significant outcomes of minor changes and employs cellular automata, complex network models, and machine learning to provide new perspectives on future societal development.

## Core | Kernels
"Life Game" is a two-dimensional grid world, and each grid can be in two states: "alive" or "dead". The rules of the game are as follows:

* Each living cell is surrounded by eight adjacent grids.
* If a living cell is surrounded by 2 or 3 living cells, the cell will continue to survive in the next generation.
* If a living cell is surrounded by 0 or 1 living cells, the cell will die in the next generation.
* If a dead cell is surrounded by 3 living cells, the cell will be resurrected in the next generation.
* The initial state of the game is randomly generated. The game will continue to iterate according to the above rules until all cells die or reach a stable state.

The concept of life cycle:

* Birth: If there are exactly three live grids around a dead grid, the grid will become a live grid at the next moment.
* Survival: If a live grid is surrounded by 2 or 3 live grids, the grid will remain alive at the next moment.
* Death: If there are less than 2 or more than 3 living cells around a live cell, the cell will become a dead cell at the next moment.
* Permanence: If there are no live cells around a dead cell, the cell will remain dead at the next moment.

Features:

* Simple rules: The rules of the game of life are very simple, only four.
* Complex behavior: Despite its simple rules, the Game of Life can produce very complex behaviors, including stable structures, oscillators, gliders and even complex structures resembling living organisms.
* Universality: The Game of Life can be used to simulate various natural phenomena, such as cell division, biological growth, population migration, etc.

## Functions to be implemented soon

* [ ] Save the evolution process in real time. Just load the existing life evolution process every time you start it. If the seeds of life are gone, start a new reincarnation (Epoch).
* [ ] Real-time statistics of the number of births, number of survivors, number of deaths and number of lives to provide statistical curvesüìâ.
* [ ] Calculate the ideal input?
   * Calculate what kind of input will last for a long time without dying?
   * Constantly conduct reincarnation experiments
   * Each round: Give a random initial life matrix.
   * Each round: Save the number of evolutions after several `evolution/evolution/trial` and entering the `steady state` (no more `evolution/evolution` or all `life units` die). (The evolution process does not need to be remembered)
   * Each round: Sort the saved content in reverse order by the number of evolutions. (It cannot be calculated by time, because time in the simulation world can be accelerated or expanded)
   * Each round: Once it enters the `steady state` (no further `evolution/evolution` or all `life units` die), the current cycle ends and a new cycle begins.

## Apply assumptions
* Simulate and calculate the ideal population size and distribution (suitable for sustainable development and survival)
* Take real-world data as input:
