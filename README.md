# Turing-Utopia-Experiment
Built upon Conway's Game of Life, referencing the Utopia Experiment, and studying the butterfly effect, the project simulates and predicts non-living phenomena. It explores significant outcomes of minor changes and employs cellular automata, complex network models, and machine learning to provide new perspectives on future societal development.
